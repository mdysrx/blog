### To Ali Amir!

Ali is a guy who likes languages, fish, birds, horses, and feeling cozy. He is sympathetic and likes to help his friends and be there for them when he can. Sometimes life is hard on him, sometimes he cries so that the tears can draw a line he can follow to a shore of peace. He likes peace and freedom for other people, and he expects the people to be kind to him, the same way he is to them.

### To be an intellectual and classy

One of the many things I like about Ali is his love for knowledge and passion for learning. He is really into learning and reading to feel content, he is an intellectual person, to say the least.

### To live with a fish

I never had a fish for decoration, but Ali has. He likes to be able to ride horses, and he likes birds. His family are awesome people, and from the little I know about them, I know they are as sentimental and sympathetic as Ali.

### Don't take him for granted

he might unintentionally fool you with his kind demeanor and welcoming nature, but that's from a place of power, not weakness. you can depend on him to get things done, and he is a person with an admirable work ethic. It's inspiring.

### If you are a woman looking for a romantic husband

And if you happen to live in Iran, even if all the odds are against my hypotheses, you can ask about Ali and get him to know you for the goal of getting married, I highly recommend Ali to you. Also, be kind to him, or you'll miss on a lot of love and romance :(

**To all the sympathy and sharing of grief, laughs, language learning, and wisdom we sometimes had, I really really wish you the best, here and hereafter \<3**
