Part of being alive is trying to be our best, and sometimes we go harsh on ourselves because we have no idea on how to look at ourselves, how to judge how we are supposed to go in life, and when is it enough. Part of this is lacking a good reference to tell us what to do.

#### Watch the full video here: [Jealousy, and how to correct our self-image](https://youtu.be/id_crwNLx7A "Jealousy, and how to correct our self-image")

#### Key points:

* Life is race, but your race is only yours, not anyone else's
* Without a reference on how to know when is enough, we will suffer
* Society is biased toward making humans more miserable, for the benefit of an elite

This was my take on the topic, and if you want to discuss more, comment on the video or reach out to me at any of the links on the homepage. Have a great day/night.
