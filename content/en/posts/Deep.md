summary: "How does it feel when you don't belive? I mean it must suck. I know my writing is horible compared to what I imagine myself to be"
---

that time when I want to go deep, to escape all the superficiality and focus, pure focus, if that makes any sense.

How many times do I feel interrupted? A lot, and that is what makes me want to focus more, and to gain all the focus I can absorb when I can.

Most of the times I focused I was able to come up with something really satisfying, and I had this feeling that I was enjoying what I was doing.

I want to write, a lot! I also feel jealous of many people, and the fact that many peop,e have reached a lot of potentials (their potential) and I didn't makes me so angry inside, and makes me feel like a I'm a forever oser. Is this true though? Is whatever I'm feeling true? What consoles me in the sse times wwhen I feel like I'm a loser? Is there anything that can help me? Yes, Allah!

How does it feel when you don't belive? I mean it must suck. I know my writing is horrible compared to what I imagine myself to be, but the fact that I'm destined to certain paths makes me feel calm, and I doubt a lot of people would feel that too if they belive. Just if.

I'll keep writing till I fell I'm no longer thirsty, and I'll keep doing it, over and over and over and over!
