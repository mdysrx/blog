### To Ali Amir!

Ali is a guy who likes lanuages, fish, birds, horses, and feeling cozy. He is really sympathetic and likes to help his friends and be there for them when he could. Someimes life is ahrd on him, sometimes he just cries so that the tears could draw a line he can follow to a shore of peace. He likes peace and freedom for other people, and he expects the peop,e to be kind to him, the same way he is to them.

### To be an intellectual and classy

One of many things I really like about Ali is his love for knowledge and passion for learning. He is really into learnig and reading to feel content, he is an intellectual person to say the least.

### To live with a fish

I never had a fish for decoration, but Ali has. He likes to be able ride horses, and he likes birds. His family are really awesome people, and from the little I know about them, I know that they are as sentimental and sympathetic just like Ali.

### Don't take him for granted

he might unintentionally fool you with his kind demeanor and welcoming nature, but that's from a place of power, not weakness. you can depend on him to get things done, and he is a person with really admirable work ethic. It's inspiring.

### If you are a woman looking for a romantic husband

And if you happen to live in Iran, even if all the odds are against my hypotheses, you can ask about Ali and get hinm to know you for the goal of getting married, I highly recommend Ali to you.

To all the sympathy and sharing of grief, laughs, language learning, and wisdom we sometimes had, I really really wish you the best ever, here and hereafter \<3
